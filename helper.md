To handle CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in Django when using a Bash script to upload a file, you need to include a valid CSRF token in your request. Below, I'll show you how to update your script to handle CSRF and how to create a Python endpoint for getting the CSRF token.

### Step 1: Modify the Bash Script to Include CSRF Token

1. **Retrieve CSRF Token:** You need to make a `GET` request to the Django form or view that provides the CSRF token. You can extract the token from the response cookies or HTML.
2. **Include the CSRF Token in the Upload Request:** Use the `curl` command to include the CSRF token.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the URL of the Django upload endpoint
URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploader/upload/"

# Define the path to the zip file to be uploaded
ZIP_FILE_PATH="path/to/your/file.zip"

# Check if the zip file exists
if [[ ! -f "$ZIP_FILE_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "File not found: $ZIP_FILE_PATH"
    exit 1
fi

# Get CSRF token from the Django site
csrf_token=$(curl -s -c cookies.txt "$URL" | grep csrfmiddlewaretoken | sed -E 's/.*value="([^"]+)".*/\1/')

# Use curl to post the zip file to the upload URL with CSRF token
response=$(curl -s -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt -w "\nHTTP_CODE:%{http_code}\n" -F "file=@$ZIP_FILE_PATH" -F "csrfmiddlewaretoken=$csrf_token" "$URL")

# Extract the HTTP response code
http_code=$(echo "$response" | grep "HTTP_CODE" | cut -d':' -f2)

# Display the result based on the HTTP response code
if [[ "$http_code" == "200" ]]; then
    echo "Zip file uploaded successfully!"
else
    echo "Failed to upload zip file. HTTP response code: $http_code"
fi
```

### Explanation:

- **`-c cookies.txt` and `-b cookies.txt`:** Save and send cookies using a temporary file named `cookies.txt`. This is necessary because Django's CSRF token is usually sent in cookies.
- **`csrf_token=$(curl ...)`**: This line makes a `GET` request to the upload URL, retrieves the CSRF token from the HTML response, and stores it in the `csrf_token` variable.
- **`-F "csrfmiddlewaretoken=$csrf_token"`**: This sends the CSRF token with the `POST` request.

### Step 2: Create a Django Endpoint to Retrieve CSRF Token

You can create a simple Django view that returns a CSRF token. You can use this endpoint to retrieve the token and use it in your upload request.

1. **Create a view to return the CSRF token**:

In your Django app, create a view in `views.py`:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.middleware.csrf import get_token

def get_csrf_token(request):
    csrf_token = get_token(request)
    return JsonResponse({'csrf_token': csrf_token})
```

2. **Add the view to your Django `urls.py`**:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    # Other paths...
    path('get-csrf-token/', views.get_csrf_token, name='get_csrf_token'),
]
```

### Step 3: Modify the Bash Script to Use the CSRF Token Endpoint

Update the `csrf_token` retrieval line in your Bash script to use the `/get-csrf-token/` endpoint:

```bash
csrf_token=$(curl -s -c cookies.txt "http://127.0.0.1:8000/get-csrf-token/" | grep csrf_token | sed -E 's/.*"csrf_token":"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
```

### Summary

- **Bash Script:** Fetches the CSRF token from a Django view and uses it in the `POST` request to upload a file.
- **Django View:** A simple endpoint to return a CSRF token, which is used to protect against CSRF attacks.

This approach ensures that your file upload process handles CSRF protection appropriately while maintaining a secure interaction with your Django backend.
