You can create a Bash script to automate the process of uploading a zip file to the Django application using `curl`, which is a powerful tool to interact with URLs and handle file uploads over HTTP.

Below is a Bash script to upload a zip file to the Django app URL:

### Bash Script to Upload a Zip File

Save the following script to a file, e.g., `upload_zip.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the URL of the Django upload endpoint
URL="http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploader/upload/"

# Define the path to the zip file to be uploaded
ZIP_FILE_PATH="path/to/your/file.zip"

# Check if the zip file exists
if [[ ! -f "$ZIP_FILE_PATH" ]]; then
    echo "File not found: $ZIP_FILE_PATH"
    exit 1
fi

# Use curl to post the zip file to the upload URL
response=$(curl -s -w "\nHTTP_CODE:%{http_code}\n" -F "file=@$ZIP_FILE_PATH" "$URL")

# Extract the HTTP response code
http_code=$(echo "$response" | grep "HTTP_CODE" | cut -d':' -f2)

# Display the result based on the HTTP response code
if [[ "$http_code" == "200" ]]; then
    echo "Zip file uploaded successfully!"
else
    echo "Failed to upload zip file. HTTP response code: $http_code"
fi
```

### How to Use the Script

1. **Replace `path/to/your/file.zip`**: Update the `ZIP_FILE_PATH` variable with the actual path to the zip file you want to upload.

2. **Make the Script Executable**: Run the following command to make the script executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x upload_zip.sh
    ```

3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to upload the zip file:

    ```bash
    ./upload_zip.sh
    ```

### Explanation of the Script

- **URL Variable**: This variable stores the URL endpoint where the zip file should be uploaded. Replace `"http://127.0.0.1:8000/uploader/upload/"` with the actual endpoint if it's different.

- **ZIP_FILE_PATH Variable**: This variable holds the path to the zip file that will be uploaded. Update it to point to your zip file.

- **File Existence Check**: The script checks if the specified zip file exists before attempting to upload it. If the file is not found, it prints an error message and exits.

- **Using `curl`**: The `curl` command with the `-F` flag is used to upload the zip file. The `-F "file=@$ZIP_FILE_PATH"` option specifies the form field name (`file`) and the file to upload (`@$ZIP_FILE_PATH`).

- **Handling the Response**: The response from the server is captured, and the HTTP status code is extracted. Based on the status code, the script prints whether the upload was successful.

### Running the Script on a Remote Server

If your Django application is hosted on a remote server, replace the URL in the script with the actual server's address, such as:

```bash
URL="http://yourserverdomain.com/uploader/upload/"
```

### Notes

- **CSRF Protection**: If your Django view requires a CSRF token for form submissions, you will need to disable CSRF protection for this view (not recommended for production), or handle CSRF tokens in your curl request. For production environments, it is better to implement an authentication method and manage CSRF tokens properly.
- **Testing**: Run the script and check if the files are being uploaded correctly and extracted into the specified folders.

This script provides a simple way to automate file uploads, which is useful for testing and batch processing scenarios.
